# ==============================================================================
# Directory Walker Configuration
# ==============================================================================
# Control how deeply Forge traverses your project structure
# Lower values = faster, less context
# Higher values = more context, slower
# Range: 1 to 10
# Recommended: 3

max_walker_depth: 3

# ==============================================================================
# Safety Limits
# ==============================================================================
# Prevent runaway conversations and API overuse

# Maximum requests per conversation turn
# When reached, Forge will ask if you want to continue
# Recommended: 25-100
max_requests_per_turn: 50

# Maximum tool failures before forcing completion
# Prevents infinite retry loops
# Recommended: 3-5
max_tool_failure_per_turn: 3

# ==============================================================================
# Advanced Settings (Optional)
# ==============================================================================
# These settings are optional and use sensible defaults if not specified

# Enable/disable specific tools (uncomment to use)
# enabled_tools:
#   - read_file
#   - write_file
#   - search_files
#   - list_directory
#   - execute_command
#   - git_operations

# Custom tool timeouts (seconds)
# tool_timeouts:
#   execute_command: 300
#   search_files: 60

# ==============================================================================
# Windows-Specific Tips
# ==============================================================================
#
# 1. File Paths:
#    - Use forward slashes (/) or double backslashes (\\\\) in YAML
#    - Example: C:/Users/YourName/project or C:\\\\Users\\\\YourName\\\\project
#
# 2. Environment Variables:
#    - Set in .env file (see .env.example)
#    - Or use Windows Environment Variables dialog
#
# 3. Shell Commands:
#    - Default shell is cmd.exe
#    - For PowerShell, set SHELL=powershell in .env
#
# 4. Line Endings:
#    - Forge handles both CRLF (Windows) and LF (Unix) automatically
#
# 5. Permissions:
#    - Run PowerShell as Administrator for system-level operations
#    - Some file operations may require elevated privileges
